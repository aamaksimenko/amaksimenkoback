# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
newsapp/.history
newsapp/.env
.history

# Ignore bundler config.
newsapp/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
newsapp/log/*
newsapp/tmp/*
!newsapp/log/.keep
!newsapp/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
newsapp/tmp/pids/*
!newsapp/tmp/pids/
!newsapp/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
newsapp/storage/*
!newsapp/storage/.keep
newsapp/tmp/storage/*
!newsapp/tmp/storage/
!newsapp/tmp/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
newsapp/config/master.key
